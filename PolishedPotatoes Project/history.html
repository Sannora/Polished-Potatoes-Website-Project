          <h1 id="origins">Origins of the Potato</h1>
          <p>
            Among many edible crops that emerged at the dawn of modern human civilization and managed to spread
            across entire world, few had their place as one of the most indispensable members of every culture's
            cuisine and most common livelihood of farmers. It's not hard to guess which crop I'm referring to by
            the context of this whole website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Potato proved itself as an efficient way both to store rugged food and feed to our ancestors who lived
            in Andes region(Bolivia and southern parts of modern-day Peru) of South America which made its way as a
            nutrition source for the last 10,000 years of civilization history.
          </p>
          <h1 id="odyssey">Potato's Odyssey</h1>
          <p>
            The story of potato began about 350 million years ago, when they started to evolve from their poisonous
            ancestor nightshade(which also evolved into tobacco, chili peppers and tomatoes). As our human ancestors
            started to settle the Andes region around 15 thousand years ago, they managed to domesticate wild potato
            of Andes around 8 millenia BC. From that point on, potato started its journey across the South American 
            sbucontinent.
          </p>
          <p>
            First spotlight drawn on it by the rest of the world was around 16th century when geographical explorations and
            colonial expansions began. Especially when Spaniards discovered the great Incan Empire and its natural riches near
            1530s. By colonization, trade, cultural exchange and destruction; potato travelled across the Atlantic Ocean
            to European mainland among with lots of exotic discoveries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Growth of potato cultivation in Europe was slow but stable. It's not hard to guess that first European potato
            farmers were the Spanish. First, Spaniards used potato as military provisions especially in overseas naval campaigns
            since its durable structure and it provided fresh nutrient to fight against scurvy which was a deadly illness for
            those days, especially common amongst sailors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Potato arrived <a href="#Britain" class="InnerLink">Britain</a> in 1585, Belgium and Germany in 1587, Austria in 1588,
            Ireland in 1589, <a href="#France" class="InnerLink">France</a> in 1600, Sweden in 1653,
            Poland in 1683(<a href="#Poland" class="InnerLink">debated</a>) and <a href="#Turkey" class="InnerLink">Ottoman Empire</a> in 1876.
            But for many years in many of these nations potato was seen as an unnecessary, weird plant which is poisonous. Reason of
            this is there has been no significant examples of plants which its root is only edible in Europe history, so potato was
            seen as some kind of devil's plant. In fact, in some instances potato was banned nationwide,
            accused of the reason of several mental and physical illnesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Potato's absolute domination on European continent wasn't until the early 19th century. This domination was tested during the
            <a href="#" class="InnerLink">Great Starvation of Ireland</a> between 1845 and 1849 when disease destroyed entire potato production
            of Ireland.
          </p>
          <p>
            United States was the last major country who adopted potato in their cuisine. For many years they used to feed this crop to horses
            and other domestic animals. After 1872, with some discoveries such as hybrid potatoes which are disease resistant it drew the attention of
            US' people.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the 20th century until modern day potato became one of the most important parts of the world's cuisine and the fourth largest food
            crop in the entire world respectively after maize, rice and wheat.
          </p>
          <p>
            As potato became an ordinary part of world's cuisine and agriculture, its growth goes gradually up in a dramatic increase taking the role
            of a major agricultural industry. Even though its origin is in America it started to spread to rest of the world from Europe, today its
            production share is mostly in Asian nations. In fact, China leads the potato production with 91,402,091.85 metric tons of potato followed
            by India with 49,771,853.88 metric tons and their closest European competitor Ukraine with 22,578,524.03 metric tons of potato production.

            In this section I will try to mention few notable incidents that potato was involved. The events are in chronological order which you can
            navigate the timeline using the navigation bar at the left.Hope it would be a fun and informative experience
            for every potato lovers. 
          </p>
          <h2 id="firstPotatoes">First Known Potatoes</h2>
          <p>
            The earliest archaeologically verified potato tuber remains have been found at the coastal side of the Peruvian district of Ancón, which
            located in Central Peru, dating back to 2500 BC. Potatoes dating back to about 2000 BC have been found in Casma Valley, a valley located
            in Peruvian region of Ancash, and potatoes dating to 800-500 BC were also uncovered at the High Plains of Bolivia, Chiripa near Lake
            Titicaca.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Potato also was found in Andes culture especially in ceramic pottery, often in shape of vessels which for some poteries takes the shape of
            a mere vegetable, for some in the form of a mutilated or full human body and for some in a transition form of both descriptions  These diverse
            types of potato descriptions in Andean art is followed by an interpration of historians as potatoes represented as social figures with great
            influence over the Andean society. The fact that potato had place in their art and cultural figures makes the potato a venerable, noble plant. 
            Knowing that the potatoes were revered since the ancient ages makes one potato lover proud. Can you imagine great chieftains of tribal societies
            represented as fat potatoes? What a noble compliment would that be...
          </p>
          <p>
            In High Plains culture, the natives used potatoes as main source of energy for the Inca Empire. Potato was consumed in variety of cooking
            types like mashing, baking, boiling and stewing in ways similar to modern methods. The Andeans also prepared a dish called "papas secas" which
            was a process that involved boiling, peeling and chopping. Then they are left to be fermented to create toqosh, a traditional Quechua dish
            which consists mostly of fermented potato dough. However, these methods were only common alternatives of potato meals. The real use of their
            potato in meals was the chuños. Chuños are preapared by letting potatoes freeze overnight on top of cold peaks of Andean mountains then leaving
            them to thaw in the morning. Running this process repeatedly for several times makes the tissue of potato much softer without any loss of nutrient
            since the enzyme activity of organisms is stopped in extreme colds but prevented any decomposition in enzyme proteins which allows potatoes
            to be lively one more just after this process. After the freeze-thaw process, farmers extract water from potato which leaves it as a soft, light
            tissue with plenty of nutrients. Then they use chuños to bake delicious, healthy stews.
          </p>
          <h2 id="spread">Potato's Spread Across the World</h2>
          <h3>Europe</h3>
          <p>
            Potato remained as unknown to the rest of the world for thousands of years while native South Americans had potato in their everyday
            life. Things started to change by the enterance of 16th century when strangers covered with shiny dresses, riding giant beasts and
            throwing hellfire from long pipes arrived to their homeland.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spaniards were the first to arrive in South America on August of 1498. Explorer Christopher Colombus set foot on the Paria Peninsula
            (modern day Venezuela) and claimed the land in the name of the king of Spain. Kingdom of Spain, after the conquest of the Moorish kingdom
            of Granada agreed the Colombus' offer to sail the ocean to find the riches of east in India and China. Three expeditions were conducted under
            the captainship of Colombus which they set foot on Venezuela in the third expedition. Colombus, as a deeply religious man, claimed that this
            land was the outer regions of the Garden of Eden. Discovery news of the new continent spred across the Europe so rapidly and daring adventurers
            like Amerigo Vespucci, Sir Francis Drake, Jacques Cartier sailed across the Atlantic Ocean funded by the European nations of Portugal, Great Britain
            and France.
          </p>
          <p>
            The discovery of Andean region howewer, wasn't until 1526 when Spanish conquisdators led by Francisco Pizarro discovered the great Incan Empire.
            It was clear that they had reached a wealthy land with prospects of great treasure, and after one more expedition (1529),
            Pizarro traveled to Spain and received royal approval to conquer the region and be its viceroy.
          </p>
          <p>
            There had been several conflicts between the Spanish and the natives which most of the time Europeans triumphed. The consciousness of the riches
            in this new empire tempted the Europeans to conduct a cycle of conquests which hundreds of colonists followed the path opened by Pizarro.
          </p>
          <p>
            With these expeditions, the Europeans brought native slaves, riches like gold and silver and of course crops like maize and potato to their homeland.
          </p>
          <p>
            Europeans in South America were aware of the potato by the mid-16th century, but refused to eat the plant. For the Spaniards the potato was regarded
            as a food for the natives: the Spanish conquerors speak most favourably of the potato but they recommend it especially for the natives who have to do
            the heaviest jobs. A similar pattern occurred in England where the potato became the food of the working class. In 1553, in the book Crónica del Peru,
            Pedro Cieza de León mentions he saw it in Quito, Popayán and Pasto in 1538. Basque fishermen from Spain used potatoes as ships' stores for their voyages
            across the Atlantic in the 16th century, and introduced the tuber to western Ireland, where they landed to dry their cod. The English privateer Sir Francis
            Drake, returning from his circumnavigation, or Sir Walter Raleigh's employee Thomas Harriot, are commonly credited with introducing potatoes into England.
            In 1588, botanist Carolus Clusius made a painting of what he called "Papas Peruanorum" from a specimen in the Low Countries; in 1601 he reported that potatoes
            were in common use in northern Italy for animal fodder and for human consumption.
          </p>
          <p>
            The news of this strange plant didn't make the same impression in whole Europe. When some in some nations it was a nutrient that can fill the stomachs of
            lots and in some it was evil and poisonous.
          </p>
          <p id="Britain">
            Sir Walter Raleigh (1552-1618), British explorer and historian known for his expeditions to the Americas, first brought the potato to Ireland and planted
            them at his Irish estate at Myrtle Grove, Youghal, near Cork, Ireland.  Legend has it that he made a gift of the potato plant to Queen Elizabeth I (1533-1603).
            The local gentry were invited to a royal banquet featuring the potato in every course.  Unfortunately, the cooks were uneducated in the matter of potatoes,
            tossed out the lumpy-looking tubers and brought to the royal table a dish of boiled stems and leaves (which are poisonous), which promptly made everyone deathly
            ill. The potatoes were then banned from court.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wherever the potato was introduced, it was considered weird, poisonous, and downright evil.  In France and elsewhere, the potato was accused of causing not only
            leprosy, but also syphilis, narcosis, scronfula, early death, sterillity, and rampant sexuality, and of destroying the soil where it grew.
          </p>
          <p id="France">
            In France the Church says God does not want people to use potatoes as food. Because of that, the French people were afraid of eating potatoes as if they were
            afraid of witchcraft.
          </p>
          <p>
            History only changed after Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, a pharmacist convinced the French to grow potatoes. He had to resort to hundreds of thousands of plans,
            taking advantage of the royal family members to make this plant popular.
          </p>
          <p>
            When famine raged in Europe from the 16th to 19th centuries, the whole continent simply could not support itself. In the end, the potatoes saved everything.
            Not only that, the sacred plant of the Incas also brought prosperity, promoted industrial revolution, nourished the army and turned European countries into mighty empires.
          </p>
          <p>
            Potato growth in the western Europe followed an exponential graph which it was one of the main supplies for military campaigns and because its cost to grow was
            so little, everyone in European society could consume potatoes.
          </p>
          <p id="Poland">
            It is said that potato also played role in several historical events such as the second Ottoman siege of Vienna where Jan Sobieski III of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, came to aid of
            Austrian defenders against the besieging Turkish army and won a glorious victory in the name of the Holy League against the Ottoman Turks. Jan Sobieski stayed in Vienna
            for a while and during his visit, as a botanist himself, saw the potato farms in rurals of Austria and decided to take samples of this strange plant.
          </p>
          <p>
            The king allegedly sent a few pounds of potato bulbs to Wilanów from his expedition to Vienna in 1683 and ordered them to be planted and multiplied in the local garden. So much
            for the legend, but does it hold true? Nobody knows for sure. There is evidence to suggest that the plant might have appeared in the area of Warsaw no sooner than at the end of
            the 18th century.
          </p>
          <p>
            So potato completed its journey almost all across the Europe, but the arrival of potato to last of the -debated- European great power of Ottoman Empire was long after the Battle
            of Vienna.
          </p>
          <p id="Turkey">
            In early 1850s the spread of potato came from Russia and Caucasia to eastern Black Sea and then to the Sakarya Plain where its first plantation was conducted in Anatolian region.
            Today, potato is a key feature of the modern-day Turkish cuisine as well.
          </p>
          <h3>Africa</h3>
          <p>
            It is generally believed that potatoes entered Africa with colonists, who consumed them as a vegetable rather than as a staple starch. Shipping records from 1567 show that
            the first place outside of Central and South America where potatoes were grown were the Canary Islands. As in other continents, despite its advantages as an anti-famine, high-elevation
            alternative to grain, potatoes were first resisted by local farmers who believed they were poisonous. As colonialists promoted them as a low-cost food, they were also a symbol of domination.
            In former European colonies of Africa, potatoes were initially consumed only occasionally, but increased production made them a staple in certain areas. Potatoes tended to become more popular
            in wartime due to their being able to be stored in the ground. It was well established as a crop by the mid-20th century and in present-day Africa they have become a vegetable or co-staple crop.
          </p>
          <p>
            In higher regions of Rwanda, potatoes have become a new staple food crop. Prior to the 1994 Rwandan genocide, consumption was as high as 153 to 200 kg per year – higher than in any Western European
            country. Recently farmers have developed the potato as a cash crop after introducing several new varieties brought back by migrant laborers from Uganda and other varieties from Kenya.
          </p>
          <h3>Asia</h3>
          <p>
            The potato diffused widely after 1600, becoming a major food resource in Europe and East Asia. Following its introduction into China toward the end of the Ming dynasty, the potato immediately became a
            delicacy of the imperial family. After the middle period of the Qianlong era (1735–96) in the Qing dynasty, population increases and a subsequent need to increase grain yields coupled with greater peasant
            geographic mobility led to the rapid spread of potato cultivation throughout China, and it was acclimated to local natural conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Peter Boomgaard looks at the adoption of various root and tuber crops in Indonesia throughout the colonial period and examines the chronology and reasons for progressive adoption of foreign crops: sweet potato
            (widespread by the 1670s), ("Irish") potato and bengkuang (yam beans) (both locally abundant by the 1780s), and cassava (from the 1860s).
          </p>
          <p>
            In India, Edward Terry mentioned the potato in his travel accounts of the banquet at Ajmer by Asaph Khan to Sir Thomas Roe, the British Ambassador in 1675. The vegetables gardens of Surat and Karnataka
            had potatoes as mentioned in Fyer's travel record of 1675. The Portuguese introduced potatoes, which they called 'Batata', to India in the early seventeenth century when they cultivated it along the
            western coast. British traders introduced potatoes to Bengal as a root crop, 'Alu'. By the end of the 18th century, it was cultivated across northern hill areas of India.[22] Potatoes were introduced
            to Tibet by the 19th century through the trade route from India.

          <h2 id="modernPotato">Potato In Modern History</h2>
          <p>
            Potato in 20th century had it place almost in every area of human life, even in politics and wars. One particular nation was spesifically embraced this plant which still has its place modern day Internet
            memes. You can take a wild guess and it wouldn't be too long for you to notice that this nation was the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics(USSR).
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Soviet Union entered the war in 1941 it faced enormous impediments to its efforts to feed itself. Agricultural production was in disarray as a result of Stalin’s programme of collectivisation,
            which had caused the devastating 1933 Ukrainian famine, in which as many as seven million people died.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wartime mobilisation deprived the countryside of some nineteen million agricultural labourers at a moment when more, rather than less, food was needed. Consequently, by 1942 both the grain and potato
            harvests fell to a third of their pre-war volume. Soldiers and civilians were constantly hungry, despite rationing. When German troops captured key agricultural zones in the Ukraine, the situation worsened further.
          </p>
          <p>
            At least three million Soviets—probably many more—starved to death during the war. Soviet officials responded by urging everyone to plant potatoes. This awkward command from high command was the origin of the Internet
            memes that is still common today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, this policy can be counted as a success. In fact, by 1943, Moscow ‘floated in a green sea of potato plants’. In 1944, such auxiliary farms produced over 2.6 million tons of potatoes and other vegetables,
            enough to ensure an additional 250 calories per day for workers lucky enough to have access to them. These efforts provided an essential source of food for perhaps 25 million people.
          </p>
          <p>
            With or without top-down encouragement people around the globe turned to potatoes to keep body and soul together during the Second World War.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soviet peasants, almost entirely reliant on foods they grew themselves, more than doubled their potato consumption. ‘They ate potatoes for breakfast, for lunch and for tea; they ate them all ways—baked, fried, in potato cakes,
            in soup, but most often simply boiled’, recalled one observer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The family of Giovanni Tassoni, poor labourers living in the countryside outside Rome, devoted their entire garden to potatoes after the occupying German military began requisitioning food in 1943.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jews starving in the Warsaw ghetto crept into the city’s hinterland the hope of digging up a few potatoes that they might smuggle back to feed their relatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing these kinds of facts makes me feel thankful and lucky personally, this might be the reason I choose potatoes to create a whole website project. I hope you enjoyed this fascinating trip on potato's everything
            and next time you eat a baked, fried, mashed or any kind of potato you feel more precious that you have the chance to eat this magnificent plant full of history and meanings.
            Whether your read all the data that I've given or not, I must thank you for you've spared your valuable time to visit my website. I hope you have a great day just like a potato! :)
