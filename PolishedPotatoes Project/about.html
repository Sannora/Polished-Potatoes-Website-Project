                <p>
                  Have you ever thought "What really is a potato?" before? I think not, since everyone knows what
                  a potato is unless they've been living in an underground bunker for the last five centuries. Nevertheless,
                  I feel the need to explain what a potato is. Because why not? Let's see what mysteries this magnificent
                  plant hide.

                <h1 id="portrayal">Portralay of Potato</h1>
                  <p>
                    Potato is a herbaceous plant which is a member of Solanaceae(Nightshades) family and is related with tomatoes
                    and tobacco.It has edible tubers. In the discussion of the Solanum, it is one of the largest genera in the
                    vegetable kingdom, about 900 names stand in the botanical books as species. It is also estimated that probably
                    700 of these are really distinct, of these 700 it is only six that grow filler potatos at all, and the remainder
                    all maintain their hold in the world, as most plants do, by means of their flower, fruits and seed. It has a
                    poisonous root except its edible tubers. Its compound shape is arranged in a spiral shape; each is around 20-30cm
                    in length and consists of a terminal leaflet and two to four pairs of leaflets. Its fruit is a small poisonous
                    berry with numerous seeds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Morphologically it can reach 70-80cm in length and 300 grams, in some extreme cases up to 1.5kg. It has white-pink flowers.
                    One of the most distinctive biological features of potatoes is it reproduces itself and doesn't need any seed structure which
                    might seem as some boring data about potatoes. But it means you can produce one whole potato just by burying a slice of unbaked
                    potato in soil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Potato tubers vary in shape and colour. Shapes may vary in four types: round, long, oval, compressed and its colour
                    may vary from yello to pink or purple. Despite its appearance, potato is made up 80% water and only 20% of solid.
                  </p>
                <h1 id="nutrient">Potato as a Nutrient</h1>
                  <p>
                    As mentioned before, the plant potato is not merely the edible part which we call "potato". Actually, it's a plant
                    with flowers and the so called "potatoes" located in its roots as tubers are some kind of an energy source of the
                    plant which stores starch(structure polysaccharide of plants). Which means potatoes store vast amounts of starch
                    which contains long chains of sugar monosaccharides.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Its nutritive value is about 90 calories. Potatoes also contain a little amount of protein along with carbonhydrate.
                    Therefore, potato is a great nutrient source for living organisms.
                   </p> 
                  <p>
                    Not peeled, baked potatoes are a good source of mineral potassium and vitamin C. It contains a considerable amount of water
                    when it's fresh and almost no fat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Potatoes usually rank high in glycemic index(measurement of how a nutrient affects blood sugar after meal), making them unsuitable
                    for people with diabetes. But its rank may change due to its variety and cooking method such as using fat or edible acids to neutralize
                    its GI. Consuming potato in a meal rich of proteins also changes its GI in a positive way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Potatoes also do not harm any of your weight losing diet.There is no evidence that potatoes, when prepared in a healthful manner,
                    impede weight loss.In fact, a study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition demonstrates that people can eat
                    potatoes and still lose weight.The study, a collaborative effort between the University of California at Davis and the Illinois Institute
                    of Technology, sought to gain a better understanding of the role of calorie reduction and the GI in weight loss when potatoes are included
                    in the diet. Ninety overweight men and women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) reduced calorie/high GI, (2) reduced
                    calorie/low GI, (3) control group with no calorie or GI restrictions. All three groups were provided potatoes along with
                    healthful recipes and instructions to consume 5-7 servings of potatoes per week. All 90 participants were involved in light to
                    moderate exercise. At the end of the 12-week study period, the researchers found that all three groups had lost weight and there
                    was no significant difference in weight loss between the groups. Although this is a single study and more research is needed, a recent
                    systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that existing research does not provide convincing evidence to suggest an association between
                    intake of potatoes and risks of obesity
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There's also a misconception which points that all the nutrients of potato are in its skin. While skin does contain approximately
                    half of the total dietary fiber, the majority of the nutrients are found within the potato itself. So the only significant loss of
                    nutrient when peeled is fiber. As a fact, a medium sized potato contains 2 grams of fiber with the skin and 1 gram of fiber without
                    its skin.
                  </p>
                <h1 id="occurance">How Does It Occur?</h1>
                  <p>
                    So how does the magic happen? As the roots grow by reproduction or ,for some kinds of potatoes, by seeds its compound
                    leaves produce starch which will be transfered to the ends of underground root fibers and those fibers thicken in volume
                    which leads to becoming a tuber. With each one or several fibers of root grow, the tubers start to grow in
                    quantity and in time, these new tubers detach from its fibers to serve as nutrient source of the plant which
                    stores a vast amount of starch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another way to produce potato is by vegetative reproduction from other potatoes. Farmers use this feature
                    of potatoes to sustain the production line in a stable path by storing some of the that years' harvest to
                    plant next season. Since this propogation way is by using a part of one individual potato, it produces new
                    generations with the exact same genetic features of vector plant. This provides a totally secure artificial
                    selection among the best potato genes.
                  </p>
              <h1 id="potatoinlangs">Potato In Languages</h1>
                <p>
                  The word potato is derived from the Spanish word "patata" and is used as the derivation of this word in most
                  of the European languages and the Spanish word is derived from one of the native American languages.
                </p>  
                <p>
                  The origin of the word is still disputed since we still know little about native American languages. It's both
                  beacuse of their distinctive means of communication and organization systems such as quipu ,an alternative way
                  of keeping records and writing which is based on beads attached to wool strings, of Incan Empire and mass
                  cultural destruction by European conquistadors. It's mostly believed that the word's origin is from one of the native South
                  American languages since biologically the plant potato's origin is most fitted for Andes climate and geography.
